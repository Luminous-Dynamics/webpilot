# üîç PyPI Token Verification Report

## Issue Summary
The PyPI tokens provided are **INVALID/EXPIRED** and cannot be used for publishing.

## Verification Tests Performed

### 1. Poetry Configuration Test
```bash
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <token>
poetry publish
```
**Result**: HTTP 403 Forbidden - "Invalid or non-existent authentication information"

### 2. Direct API Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```
**Result**: HTTP 403 - Authentication rejected

### 3. Token Format Analysis
Both tokens follow the correct PyPI token format:
- Start with `pypi-` prefix
- Base64 encoded payload
- Proper structure

However, the server rejects them as invalid.

## Root Cause
The tokens are either:
1. **Expired** - PyPI tokens can have expiration dates
2. **Revoked** - Manually revoked from PyPI account
3. **Incorrectly copied** - Though format appears correct
4. **Scope limited** - May not have upload permissions

## Token Storage Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Stored
1. **Bitwarden Entry Created**: "PyPI - WebPilot Publishing Tokens"
   - Contains both TestPyPI and PyPI tokens
   - Includes configuration commands
   - Marked with note about expiration

2. **Local Documentation**: `PYPI_CREDENTIALS_SECURE.md`
   - Backup copy of credentials
   - Configuration instructions
   - Note about need for regeneration

### ‚ùå Cannot Use for Publishing
- Poetry configuration accepts tokens but server rejects them
- Both TestPyPI and PyPI tokens fail authentication
- Publishing blocked until new tokens are generated

## Resolution Steps

### Generate New Tokens

1. **For TestPyPI**:
   - Visit: https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - Login to your account
   - Create new API token with "Upload packages" scope
   - Name it: "claude-webpilot-testpypi"

2. **For PyPI**:
   - Visit: https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - Login to your account
   - Create new API token with "Upload packages" scope
   - Name it: "claude-webpilot-pypi"

### Configure New Tokens

```bash
# TestPyPI
poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
poetry config pypi-token.testpypi <new-testpypi-token>

# PyPI
poetry config pypi-token.pypi <new-pypi-token>
```

### Test Publishing

```bash
# Test with TestPyPI first
poetry publish --repository testpypi

# If successful, publish to PyPI
poetry publish
```

## Current Package Status

- **Package Built**: ‚úÖ `claude_webpilot-1.3.0-py3-none-any.whl`
- **GitHub Release**: ‚úÖ Published at https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/webpilot/releases/tag/v1.3.0
- **PyPI Publication**: ‚ùå Blocked by invalid tokens
- **Documentation**: ‚úÖ Created and ready

## Summary

The tokens were correctly stored in Bitwarden and saved to documentation, but they are **invalid for authentication** with PyPI. This is likely because they have expired or were revoked. New tokens must be generated from your PyPI account to complete the publication process.

The package is otherwise ready for publication - just needs valid authentication tokens.
