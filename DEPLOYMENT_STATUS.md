## ‚úÖ Resolved: GitHub Secret Scanning

### The Problem (Resolved)
GitHub's push protection detected a PyPI API token in an old commit.

- **Original Commit**: f8993665e2c19479eccf3380fa5595fa9b61cfe6
- **File**: .pypi-credentials-secure:10
- **Impact**: Blocked push until resolved

### The Solution (Implemented)
Used `git filter-branch` to completely remove the file from git history:

```bash
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .pypi-credentials-secure" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
```

**Result**: File completely removed from all commits, force pushed successfully to GitHub

### Deployment Completed

```bash
# Verification of successful deployment
git push origin main --force --tags

# Output:
To https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/webpilot.git
   23cfd25..d1309f2  main -> main
 * [new tag]         v2.0.0 -> v2.0.0
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Secret removed, history cleaned, v2.0.0 deployed

## üéØ Post-Deployment Actions

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. ‚úÖ Cleaned git history (removed secret completely)
2. ‚úÖ Force pushed to GitHub: `git push origin main --force --tags`
3. ‚úÖ v2.0.0 tag deployed successfully
4. ‚úÖ All documentation updated

### üìã Recommended Next Steps
1. **Create GitHub Release** - Convert tag to release page with notes
   - Visit: https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/webpilot/releases/new?tag=v2.0.0
   - Add release notes highlighting 63% performance improvement

2. **Security Hygiene** - Manage PyPI credentials
   - Revoke old token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
   - Generate new token if needed for future releases
   - Store securely (environment variables, never commit)

3. **Enable Secret Scanning** - Prevent future issues
   - Visit: https://github.com/Luminous-Dynamics/webpilot/settings/security_analysis
   - Enable Secret Scanning for better secret management

4. **Monitor & Iterate**
   - Watch for user feedback
   - Address any issues that arise
   - Begin v2.1 development (see ROADMAP_v2.1.md)

- **30-40% less code** required for same functionality

### Features Added
- Multi-browser support (Firefox, Chromium, WebKit)
- Network interception and logging
- Resource blocking for performance
- Auto-waiting eliminates race conditions
- Text-based selectors for readability

### Compatibility

## üîí Security Note

The PyPI token in the old commit should be:
1. **Revoked** if it's still active (visit https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/)
2. **Replaced** with a new token stored securely (not in git)
3. **Removed** from git history eventually (optional but recommended)

For now, allowing it via GitHub's URL is the fastest path to deployment, but consider the security best practices above for long-term hygiene.
