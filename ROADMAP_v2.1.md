# üó∫Ô∏è WebPilot v2.1 Roadmap

**Target Release**: Q1 2026
**Focus**: Enhanced Debugging & Developer Experience

---

## üéØ Goals

Building on v2.0.0's successful Playwright migration, v2.1 will focus on:

1. **Enhanced Debugging** - Make troubleshooting tests effortless
2. **Better DX** - Improve developer experience with modern tooling
3. **Advanced Features** - Leverage more Playwright capabilities
4. **Production Readiness** - Enterprise-grade reliability

---

## ‚ú® Planned Features

### 1. Video Recording of Test Sessions
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium
**Value**: High

```python
with PlaywrightAutomation(record_video=True) as browser:
    browser.navigate("example.com")
    browser.click("Login")
    # Automatically saves video of entire session
```

**Benefits**:
- Debug test failures visually
- Share test recordings with team
- Document user flows
- Reproduce bugs easier

**Implementation**:
- Leverage Playwright's built-in video recording
- Auto-save videos on test failure
- Configurable video quality/size
- Integration with test reports

---

### 2. Trace Viewer Integration
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium
**Value**: High

```python
with PlaywrightAutomation(trace=True) as browser:
    browser.navigate("example.com")
    # Generate trace file for Playwright Inspector
```

**Benefits**:
- Step-by-step action replay
- Network request inspection
- Console log viewing
- DOM snapshots at each step

**Implementation**:
- Auto-generate trace files
- One-command trace viewer launch
- CI/CD trace artifact upload
- Trace comparison tools

---

### 3. Page Object Model (POM) Helpers
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Medium
**Value**: Medium

```python
from src.webpilot.patterns import PageObject, locator

class LoginPage(PageObject):
    url = "https://example.com/login"

    username = locator("#username")
    password = locator("#password")
    submit = locator("button", text="Sign in")

    def login(self, user, pwd):
        self.username.fill(user)
        self.password.fill(pwd)
        self.submit.click()

# Usage
page = LoginPage(browser)
page.navigate()
page.login("user", "pass")
```

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner test organization
- Reusable page components
- Type hints for better IDE support
- Reduced code duplication

**Implementation**:
- Base `PageObject` class
- Decorator-based locators
- Auto-waiting built-in
- IDE autocomplete support

---

### 4. Async/Await Support
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: High
**Value**: Medium

```python
from src.webpilot.core import AsyncPlaywrightAutomation

async with AsyncPlaywrightAutomation() as browser:
    await browser.navigate("example.com")
    await browser.click("Sign in")
    result = await browser.get_text("#result")
```

**Benefits**:
- Parallel test execution
- Better performance for I/O operations
- Modern Python async patterns
- Integration with FastAPI/aiohttp

**Implementation**:
- New `AsyncPlaywrightAutomation` class
- Async context managers
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Documentation & examples

---

## üöÄ Nice-to-Have Features

### Mobile Browser Emulation
```python
browser = PlaywrightAutomation(
    device="iPhone 12"  # Built-in device presets
)
```

### Advanced Network Mocking
```python
browser.mock_api("/api/users", {
    "users": [{"name": "Test User"}]
})
```

### Visual Regression Testing
```python
browser.screenshot("homepage")
assert browser.compare_screenshot("homepage", threshold=0.95)
```

### Component Testing
```python
# Test individual components in isolation
component = browser.mount_component("LoginForm")
component.fill({"username": "test"})
```
