## 🎯 What's Missing (The 10% Gap)

### 1. Development Server Integration 🚧
**Status**: Not implemented
**Need**: Auto-detect dev servers (vite, webpack-dev-server, next dev)

```python
# What we need:
class DevServerIntegration:
    def detect_dev_server(self) -> Dict:
        """Find running dev server (port 3000, 5173, 8080)"""
        
    def wait_for_hot_reload(self):
        """Wait for HMR to complete before testing"""
        
    def inject_error_overlay_reader(self):
        """Read build errors from dev server overlay"""
```

**Impact**: 🔥 HIGH - Makes iterative development seamless

### 2. Lighthouse Integration 🚧
**Status**: Playwright supports it, not wrapped yet
**Need**: Automated performance/accessibility scoring

```python
# What we need:
class LighthouseRunner:
    def audit_page(self, url: str) -> Dict:
        """Run Lighthouse audit"""
        return {
            'performance': 95,
            'accessibility': 100,
            'seo': 90,
            'best_practices': 88
        }
    
    def compare_with_baseline(self):
        """Detect performance regressions"""
```

**Impact**: 🔥 HIGH - Catches performance/a11y issues instantly

### 3. Visual Regression Testing 🚧
**Status**: Screenshot comparison exists, needs automation
**Need**: Pixel-perfect visual diff

```python
# What we need:
class VisualRegression:
    def take_baseline(self, name: str):
        """Save baseline screenshot"""
        
    def compare_with_baseline(self, name: str) -> Dict:
        """Pixel diff, returns % difference"""
        
    def approve_new_baseline(self):
        """Accept visual changes"""
```

**Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Catches CSS regressions

### 4. Accessibility Auditing 🚧
**Status**: Partial (Lighthouse has it)
**Need**: Deep a11y testing

```python
# What we need:
class AccessibilityTester:
    def check_wcag_compliance(self) -> List[Dict]:
        """Check WCAG 2.1 AA compliance"""
        
    def test_keyboard_navigation(self):
        """Verify tab order, focus management"""
        
    def test_screen_reader_compatibility(self):
        """Check ARIA labels, roles"""
```

**Impact**: 🔥 HIGH - Makes sites accessible to everyone

### 5. Component Testing 🚧
**Status**: Not implemented
**Need**: Isolated component testing

```python
# What we need:
class ComponentTester:
    def test_component(self, component_path: str):
        """Test React/Vue/Svelte component in isolation"""
        
    def test_all_props_combinations(self):
        """Test component with different props"""
        
    def generate_component_screenshots(self):
        """Visual component library"""
```

**Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Faster component development

### 6. E2E Test Generator 🚧
**Status**: Has NLP, needs test generation
**Need**: Auto-generate tests from user stories

```python
# What we need:
class TestGenerator:
    def generate_from_user_story(self, story: str) -> str:
        """
        Input: "As a user, I want to sign in to see my dashboard"
        Output: Complete test code
        """
        
    def learn_from_manual_session(self):
        """Record human actions, generate test"""
```

**Impact**: 🔥 HIGH - Test creation becomes instant

### 7. Smart Selector Generation 🚧
**Status**: Basic selectors only
**Need**: Resilient, auto-healing selectors

```python
# What we need:
class SmartSelector:
    def generate_resilient_selector(self, element) -> str:
        """Generate selector that survives DOM changes"""
        
    def auto_heal_broken_selector(self, old_selector: str):
        """Find element even if selector changed"""
```

**Impact**: 🟡 MEDIUM - Tests stay stable
