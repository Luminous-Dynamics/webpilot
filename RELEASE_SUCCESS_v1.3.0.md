## 📝 Key Learning

The initial token issue was due to incorrect usage - PyPI tokens must be used with:
- Username: `__token__`
- Password: The token value (including `pypi-` prefix)

Poetry handles this automatically with `poetry config pypi-token.pypi <token>`.

## 🎊 Release Complete!

WebPilot v1.3.0 is now fully released and available to the public. All enhancements have been implemented, tested, and deployed successfully!
